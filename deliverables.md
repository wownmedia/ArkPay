# Deliverables
## Context
* ArkTippr is a consumer/end-user-oriented application build/running that uses the ARK blockchain. Currently ArkTippr is running exclusively on the Reddit platform, offering basic transaction services. 
* ARK Pay is a simple open-source library that provides merchants with the ability to easily accept ARK as a means of payment in online stores.

Integrating, and expanding upon, ArkTippr and ARK Pay into one service will create a full 2nd layer payment system for ARK (and bridgechains). 
The deliverables to achieve the integration can be separated into 5 categories: 
1. Platform Expantions
2. API/Webhooks
3. ARK Pay Integration
4. DEX
5. Improvements
